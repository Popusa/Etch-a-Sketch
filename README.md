This is the "Etch-a-Sketch" project that I built as part of The Odin Project cirriculum.

It was used to further practice on DOM manipulation, adding event listeners, and deeper javascript knowledge and practice.

A very special thanks to "superbia" for helping me fix a very persistent bug in the grid.
